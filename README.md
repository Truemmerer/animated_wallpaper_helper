1. sudo (For automatic installation and uninstallation)

### shipped by install.sh:
2. ffmpeg

# Installation
## Automatic installation
**This will install the dependencies directly with and move the files to the correct places.**
**Fedora, Arch Linux, Manjaro and Ubuntu supported**
**Also, children distros are supported.**

1. chmod +x install.sh
2. bash ./install.sh

## Manual Installation
1. Move the folder "awp" to /usr/local/share/
2. Move the ".desktop" file to /usr/share/applications/

# Notice:
1. The X11 version of GNOME is recommended for this, as this will only work on a Wayland workspace.
